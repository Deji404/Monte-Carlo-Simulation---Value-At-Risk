# Monte Carlo Simulation - Value At Risk

## Tools Used: Python

### Description
This is part of the requirements for completion of the Modeling Risk with Monte Carlo Simulation course, which I took as part of the Business Intelligence and Data Analyst (BIDA) certification offered by the Corporate Finance Institute in conjunction with alX.

Monte Carlo Simulation, also known as the Monte Carlo Method or a multiple probability simulation, is a mathematical technique, which is used to estimate the possible outcomes of an uncertain event.

In this course, we used the Monte Carlo method to forecast, among other things, the value at risk of a stock investment. We observed the best-case scenario, the worst-case scenario, and the range of possible scenarios using the empirical rule.

The Python code is provided in an .ipynb format.
